# Zomato_EDA_Python_Project
## Project Overview
This project analyzes Zomato's restaurant data to uncover trends in customer behavior, sales performance, and restaurant ratings.  
By using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we extract insights into how restaurant factors impact ratings and customer preferences.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Data Cleaning, Processing, and Visualization  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data analysis
